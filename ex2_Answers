What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?

Increasing the number of hidden nodes in a neural network can improve accuracy
by learning complex patterns but also risks overfitting, leading to poor test performance.
It increases training time and computational demands, and can cause issues with vanishing or
exploding gradients. Balancing the number of hidden nodes is crucial; using regularization
and cross-validation helps optimize their number and maintain robust performance.

Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?

As the number of hidden nodes in a neural network increases, accuracy initially improves as
themodel learns more complex patterns. This continues until an optimal point is reached.
Beyond this, accuracy may plateau or decline due to overfitting, where the model memorizes
training data instead of generalizing. Excessive hidden nodes can also cause performance instability.
Balancing the number of hidden nodes is key for optimal accuracy.
